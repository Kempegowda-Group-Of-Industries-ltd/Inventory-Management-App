![Screenshot](image/Streamlit-APP-Image.png)  

Welcome to my Inventory Management Application! This project showcases how to use Streamlit to create powerful data applications by embedding a Python script as the backend. The application integrates a SQLite3 database, a lightweight and serverless solution, to efficiently manage inventory computations.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an Inventory Management system designed for Mombasa Maize Millers, a leading Kenyan-based grain processing manufacturer. The application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to:
- **View Current Inventory:** Quickly access up-to-date inventory levels.
- **Add or Sell Products:** Seamlessly manage stock by adding new products or recording sales.
- **Delete a Product:** Remove obsolete or incorrect entries from the inventory.
- **Adjust Stock Balance:** Make adjustments to stock levels as needed.

## Features
- **Security:** Access to the application is secured by login credentials, ensuring that only authorized users can manage the inventory. The app also supports password changes and new user registration.
- **Versatility:** The application is accessible on both computers and mobile devices, offering flexibility for users on the go.

## Technology Stack
- **Python:** The core programming language used to build the application.
- **Streamlit:** The framework used to create the interactive web interface.
- **SQLite3:** The database used to manage inventory data without the need for a server.
